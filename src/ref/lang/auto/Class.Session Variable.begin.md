Use Session Variables to store data server-side in a key-value format. You can use it to cache, for example, configurations and app context data. 

Session Variables are cleared when the end users log out of the app or when they close all browser windows.

Session Variables are available in Web App only. You can use the variables with many data types, but we don't recommend them for the [compound data types](<../../data/data-types/available-data-types.md>) due to performance considerations. 

You can add a Session Variable by clicking **Data** tab > **Session Variables** > **Add Session Variable**.
