List Records widget displays the records in a list layout. After you drag this widget to the Screen, you need to supply data to it and set up how records show. 

![List Records Widget overview](<images/list-records.png?width=600>)

Here are some additional notes.

1. Find List Records in the widget toolbox and drag it to the main editor, just like other widgets.
2. Use the **Line Separator** property to set up how the list shows in the Screen. You can separate the records by a new line, bullets, or not separate them at all.
3. The **Preparation** Action is often used to supply data to the widgets in Traditional Web App.
4. In our example, we dragged the FirstName and LastName Attributes from the related Entity to the List Widget to get a full name in one line. We set the **Line Separator** to **New Line**. The main editor shows a preview of the list, but make sure you try it out by publishing your app as well.
