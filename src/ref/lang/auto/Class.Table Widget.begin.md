Allows you to organize the content of the screen in a table, where you can drag and drop other widgets.

You will be able to manage the table layout by performing the following operations in the table toolbox: 

* Insert, delete and order rows or columns
* Merge and split table cells

Although not available in the widgets toolbox, the [Row](Class.Row Widget.final.md) and [Cell](Class.Cell Widget.final.md) of a table are also widgets with its own properties.
