Displays a single record of an Entity or a Structure.

<div class="info" markdown="1">

The layout of the Show Record widget is implemented in a tabular way, which limits the organization of the inputs and its captions. The [Form widget](<ServiceStudio.Plugin.Widgets.Form.final.md>) implements the same functionality with a more flexible layout.

Use the [Form widget](<ServiceStudio.Plugin.Widgets.Form.final.md>) instead of the Show Record widget to display a single record of an Entity or a Structure.

</div>
