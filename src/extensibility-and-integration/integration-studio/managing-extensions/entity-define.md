# Define Extension Entities

Once you have created your extension, simply define the **entities** exported by the extension. These entities allow you to use database tables that exist outside OutSystems.

![](images/warning.gif) To publish a new extension that contains entities, your OutSystems user must have the "Allow External Entities" permission. Check with the Service Center administrator for a list of your permissions.

To add an entity to your extension, do one of the following operations:

* [Add the entity](<entity-add.md>) manually to the extension. 
* Import the entity definition from a database, through the [Import Entities from Database](<entity-import-from-database.md>) wizard.
