# Entity Attributes

Once your entity is [created](<entity-define.md>), you can add, change, or delete its parameters in the [Entity Attributes Editor](<../../../ref/integration-studio/editor/action-parameters.md>). 

You have to create the attributes according to the definition of the database table that you want to access in your application.
