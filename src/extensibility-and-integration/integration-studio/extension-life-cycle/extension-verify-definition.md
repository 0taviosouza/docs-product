# Verify the Extension Definition

The Verify the Extension Definition operation checks whether the extension is valid. An extension is valid if it does not have any errors, although warnings are allowed.

Do the following:

1. In the File menu or Toolbar, click Verify ![](images/validate.gif), Verify and Save ![](images/verify-save-icon.gif), or [1-Click Publish](<extension-1-cp.md>) ![](images/1-click-publish-icon.gif).
1. The [Verify window](<extension-verify.md>) is launched and you can check the [errors](<../../../ref/errors-and-warnings/errors-is/intro.md>) and [warnings](<../../../ref/errors-and-warnings/warnings-is/intro.md>) found during the verification of your extension in the [Verify window](<extension-verify.md>).
